				&nbsp; Boston Terriers are medium sized dogs that are gentle, affectionate dogs 
				that are grouped in the "companion group" of dogs. They were given the
				nickname "The American Gentleman" because of their tuxedo-like markings.

				&nbsp; The "American Gentlemen" are 1 foot to 1 foot 3 inches tall, 10 to 25 pounds,
				and have a life span of 14-16 years. They have short coats that are white and black,
				white and brindle, or white and seal. They have very large eyes, very short
				tails, and ears that stand upright.

				&nbsp; Boston Terriers are very athletic dogs, but do not do well
				in weather that is too hot or too cold. Bostons do not bark often, only when 
				they get excited, riled up or head someone at the door. But, they are
				known for their snoring. Overall, Boston Terriers are good family dogs, because
				they are very good with people (especially kids) and other dogs.
